# Hi! 

<p>I am a graduate from Pellissippi State Community College with an associates degree in Computer Programming. Courses completed include Programming in Java I & II, Internet Software Development using JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and Less. Also, Advanced Database and Programming, Data Management Systems, Systems Analysis and Design, and Applied Systems Development.</p>

<p>I currently have 15+ years experience as a Senior Photographer at Jewelry Television in the in-house jewelry and gemstone photography department. I am also a former Senior Mechanical Production Artist at Publishers Clearing House in New York with over 20 years of professional Adobe Photoshop experience. I am a dedicated, hard working employee, as well as a problem solver. Currently, I am pursuing a different career path, one that aims toward a new career in Technology. More specifically, Web Development. Hereâ€™s what I can bring to your table, I am the kind of employee that excels at his job once settled in. The following are three examples of this:</p>

<p>When I first entered the workforce, I worked as a printing pressman for a small shop in Williston Park, NY. I apprenticed under the current pressman. Within the year, I became head pressman in charge of all offset lithographic printing for that shop.</p>

<p>Then, while fulfilling a temp position at Publishers Clearing House, I quickly learned the ins and outs of the job very well. The manager at the time was so impressed with my work, they bought me out of my temp contract and hired me full-time. I was brought on as a Senior Mechanical Artist in that department.</p>

<p>And finally, when I was first hired at Jewelry Television, having no prior photography experience, with the given training I received, I soon excelled. In a short time, a position for supervisor opened up and my boss strongly urged me to apply for the role. I got that role and have been there for over fifteen years now.</p>

<p>I attribute these previous successes to a few things. I am efficient, loyal, committed, and easy to work with. I do not quit when times get tough. Difficult situations are what make me rethink my strategy and try harder. Since the job market is pretty tough right now, especially for someone just having graduated, I took the initiative and began further study of what I did not know and what I thought would bring more value to a role in a Tech position. And as of now, I am building my portfolio and learning a lot. I know that my portfolio may be far from impressive, but I believe that it shows that Iâ€™ve mastered the basics, and as I build it further and gain more experience, I can excel the way Iâ€™ve excelled in previous jobs.</p>
