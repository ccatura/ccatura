<h1>Hi!</h1> 

<div class="scroll">
<p>Previously I was part of Moxley Carmichael's (MoxCar Communications) Web Development team. My role involved creating and managing many client websites while maintaining consistent standards across their online platforms.</p>

<p>I hold a Computer Programming degree from Pellissippi State Community College, where I completed courses such as Programming I & II (Java), Web/Internet Software Development (JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS), Advanced Database and Programming (SQL), Data Management Systems, Systems Analysis and Design, and Applied Systems Development. I am presently expanding my skill set by delving into React JS and plan to consistently explore current and pertinent programming technologies.</p>

<p>Earlier, I served as a Senior Mechanical Production Artist at Publishers Clearing House in New York, bringing over 20 years of Adobe Photoshop experience to the table. I pride myself on my dedication, hard work, and problem-solving skills. I also spent 15+ years as a Senior Jewelry and Gemstone Photographer at Jewelry Television and currently hold a Photography Management position in Manhattan.</p>

<p>My capabilities extend beyond these roles, covering areas like logo design, graphic design, 3D modeling, animation, and photography. I'm also skilled in music, with expertise in singing, songwriting, piano, acoustic guitar, ukulele, and audio recording.</p>

<p>Feel free to explore my portfolio website at https://charliecatura.com for a glimpse of my work. There, you'll find a collection of both current and past web development projects to browse through.</p>
