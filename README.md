# Hi! 

I am a Computer Programming graduate from Pellissippi College in Knoxville, TN. I am currently privately studying (more) web development in hopes to begin a new career within the coming year.

At the moment I am building a long awaited portfolio page to showcase  some of my upcoming work. Unfortunately the school's focus was not on providing resources for students to build a portfolio, rather just to learn the basics of programming. So, it is up to me to continue my pursuit of programming, more specifically, web development, and in time I will begin my job search.

More to come as I learn!
